# Time To Blog

I am a Web3 Security Researcher, it's not a protected term like `Doctor` so I think I get to just say I am, right?

## Why, What, How, Who?
About a month ago I began my journey into becoming a Web 3 Security Researcher. I choose a pseudonym based on the [Penguins of Madagascar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gr4voxOZFfY), made socials, and began* the journey of learning.

*Okay, well technically I have done a few little personal projects in Crypto over the past few years, so its not like I started from complete zero.*

Some things I have done in the past:

- Implemented a simple proof of work Blockchain.
- Implemented a simple VM into that simple Blockchain, far from EVM level functionality, but still educational.
- Learned Solidity, and wrote various small uninteresting projects.
- Completed a portion of the Ethernaut challenges.
- Tried my hand (unsuccessfully) in a Code4rena contest or two.

Nevertheless, I was just window shopping, now I am back and serious about getting into Web3.

Over the past month I have:
- Completed the Cyrfrin Updraft Security and Auditing course.
- (re)Completed (most) of the Ethernaut Challenges.
- Competed in two Codehawks First Flights.
- Found and Submitted my first bug in a real contest.
- Started the Cyfrin Updraft Security and Auditing course again. ?
- Made a blog, without ever posting an article. ??
- Switched to Neovim. ???
- Switched to Nixos. ????

I think it's clear that I have lost focus.

## Why Blog?
I procrastinated by coding this blog about a month ago, despite never actually writing an article. I knew that a lot of security researchers had their own blog, so I assumed I would too, but I did not actually know WHY I needed a blog yet, hence, no article.

It was not until today, when I saw a [thread by Owen Thurm](https://twitter.com/0xOwenThurm/status/1770153541694632037) about breaking through `the barrier` that I understood, in particular it was section 5:

```
5. Get The Feedback Loop Right

Your feedback loop is everything when it comes to mastering a new skill.  

Auditing is no exception.  

If your feedback loop is off you can spend months working without making any noticeable progress...
```

I have not been making no noticeable progress for months yet, but I am certain that if I where to continue as I am now, I would not have much to show for it in three months.

However, if I blog, I close the feedback loop.

I am not under the impression that people will actually read my blogs and give me feedback, I very much expect to be blogging into the abyss.

But by:

1. Making a clear end goal in the form of a written up blog for a project/subject/whatever, it will be much easier to keep focus on it until it is done.
2. Blogging about the project/subject/whatever, it will force me to think deeply about it, giving immediate (self)feedback.

So that's that, that's why I have chosen to start this blog.

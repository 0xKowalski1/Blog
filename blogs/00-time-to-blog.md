# Time To Blog

Time to blog

want to document thoughts in journey to auditor

dont want to use a boring normal blogging tool/site

Wanted to build a simple, lean blog with no external dependencies/libraries or frameworks

link to code

mostly succeeded, google font is a dependency, code is slightly more bloated then I would like due to chasing SPA features

but need to pick a point to stop

Oh well, atleast I can blog now
